# Draw cards

Simple page to draw cards from a shuffled deck. When deck is running out of cards, draws the last cards, reshuffles then draws remaning desired cards.

This gave me a few ideas for some online or local offline cards games... Maybe in the future I will expand this into a couple games other than just drawing cards.
